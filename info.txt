Open the main.unity scene.
Remove Vuforia Components:
Delete the ARCamera and ImageTarget GameObjects from the scene.
Add ARFoundation Components:
Add a new GameObject and name it AR Session. Add the ARSession component to it.
Add another new GameObject and name it AR Session Origin. Add the ARSessionOrigin and ARTrackedImageManager components to it.
Configure the ARTrackedImageManager:
In the ARTrackedImageManager component, you will need to create a new XRReferenceImageLibrary and add your target images to it.
Set the Max Number Of Moving Images to a value greater than 0 (e.g., 1).
Configure the VideoController:
Select the GameObject that has the VideoController script attached to it.
Drag the ARTrackedImageManager from the AR Session Origin GameObject to the M Tracked Image Manager field in the VideoController's inspector.
Ensure the M Video Player and M Hand Target fields are still correctly assigned.
After completing these steps, the application should be ready to build and run with ARFoundation.
